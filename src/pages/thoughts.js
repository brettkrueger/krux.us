      <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a small town you may have heard of called Austin. It's smack in the middle of Texas, so it's pretty hard to miss.
      I first got into computers around age 10 when I built my first gaming PC with my mom using Building a PC for Dummies. The early naughts were a simpler time.</p>
      <p>As you can tell, I'm not a designer. This site is built using WordPress' REST API and Gatsby, and it uses the most basic template Gatsby comes with.
      My skills are primarily focused on backend development. I work with languages such as PHP, Python, and NodeJS to accomplish my goals (BASH too, of course, but we don't talk about that).</p>
      <sub>I don't have a traditional blog page, so here's...</sub>
      <h3>My Thoughts</h3>

            <p>{node.title}</p>
          </Link>
          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: node.excerpt }} />
